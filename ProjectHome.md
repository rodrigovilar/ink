Ink is an adaptive object model (AOM) framework .The Ink framework is Java based with a Smalltalk-like metamodel. DSL development in Ink is easy and intuitive. Changes to DSL definition are reflected at runtime, making Ink applications adaptable.

The Ink framework is based on three design principles that enable programming with DSLs to scale up : Strong typing, an integrated DSL-Java development environment, and an interpretive approach.

Ink is a descendant of the ModelTalk framework (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1591888.1592158, http://www.dsmforum.org/events/DSM08/Papers/8-Schachter.pdf).
