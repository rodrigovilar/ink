#summary Ink is an AOM framework.

= Introduction =

Ink is an adaptive object model (AOM) framework. The Ink framework provides Java programmers with a Smalltalk-like reflective metamodel. Changes to the model are reflected at runtime, making applications implemented with Ink highly adaptable. Ink is designed for developing DSLs with the intention of making DSL development easy and intuitive.

Ink is a framework for developing agile software.  Ink promotes agility by providing good support for:
  * AOM – end users can change the system structure and behavior and their changes are immediately reflected in the system.
  * DSLs – non-developers can participate in the development process; architects can govern the model.
