#summary Ink is an AOM framework.

Ink is an adaptive object model (AOM) framework. The Ink framework is Java based with a Smalltalk-like metamodel. DSL development in Ink is easy and intuitive. Changes to DSL definition are reflected at runtime, making Ink applications adaptable.

Ink is a framework for developing agile software.  Ink promotes agility by providing good support for:
  * AOM – end users can change the system structure and behavior and their changes are immediately reflected in the system.
  * DSLs – non-developers can participate in the development process; architects can govern the model.
