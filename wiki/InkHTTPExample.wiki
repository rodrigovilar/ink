Ink language has unified syntax rules for all DSLs.  This saves language users the need to learn new syntax rules for each DSL and saves DSL developers the effort in defining syntax.

Ink uses SDL syntax (see TBD) with the only difference that period (".") is a legal character in a name.

In this tutorial you will learn how to define ink elements and use ink language features such as inheritance between objects, traits and more.  The example in this tutorial is based on an article that describes how executable modeling can be achieved by using dependency injection (see http://www.dsmforum.org/events/DSM08/Papers/8-Schachter.pdf)

The tutorial covers the following topics:
  * Defining a class
  * Defining an instance
  * Object inheritance


  * Inner object inheritance and override
  * Meta-class extensibility
  * Traits
  * Property type refinement
  * Aspects...

The example doesn't cover the behavior part of the DSL (which is implemented in Java).  For more on this see TBD.
